# Activity Detector

A machine learning application to detect human activity based on smartphone data.

## Setup

1. Install Python3, if you haven't already. Once that is done, install the external dependencies listed below using `pip3 install` in the command line:
    1. `flask`
    2. `numpy`
    3. `pandas`
    4. `scipy`
    5. `sklearn`
    6. `matplotlib`

2. Run `python3 server.py` to start the web server. 

3. Open `localhost:5000` to interact with the application. There are sample data files in the `sample_input_data` folder - uploading these files to the application and clicking "Send Data" will demonstrate the algorithm.
